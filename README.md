## personal project
- [thegallery.onthewifi.com](https://thegallery.onthewifi.com/) (2020.03)
![theGallery-homepage](/images/homepage.png)
This is a **image-sharing platform** now only features basic album creating and managing function.<br><br>
Since this project is driven by my interest (photographing) and that I'm still continuously working on it,<br>
I'd like to say that it'll grow up with more functions soon.<br><br>
You're more than welcome to take a look then :).<br><br>
The project is developed as a single page application and uses:
    - React + Redux
    - Express + MySQL<br><br>
