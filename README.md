## personal project
- [thegallery.onthewifi.com](https://thegallery.onthewifi.com/) (2020.03)
![theGallery-homepage](/images/homepage.png)
This is a **image-sharing platform** now only features basic album creating and managing function.<br><br>
Since this project is driven by my interest (photographing) and that I'm still continuously working on it,<br>
I'd like to say that it'll grow up with more functions soon.<br><br>
You're more than welcome to take a look then :).<br><br>
The project is developed as a single page application and uses:
    - React + Redux
    - Express + MySQL<br><br>

## React Practice
- [instagram layout imitation](https://j8453.github.io/React/igimitation.html) (2020.04)<br>
I was trying to mock instagram layout with 'React' and 'Semantic UI React' (an UI component library).<br><br>
It's also a RWD practice.<br><br>
The following is my output:

As a contrast, the following is real instagram layout:

- [styled-component practice](https://j8453.github.io/React/styled-component/index.html) (2020.04)<br>
It's a simple practice with 'Styled-Components' (a CSS-in-JS library), and use 'Styled-System' to support.
